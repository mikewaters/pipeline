## TODO

    - attach callbacks to an entire pipeline
    - parallel task composition using group    
    - dont log all the output of a shell command to the logger
    
    - figure out how to make test-scoped registries using pytest fixtures.
    (similar to how we make celery app test-local using a fixture)
